I had the same concerns when my son enrolled at UC Irvine a few years earlier.I need not have worried.At a celebratory dinner a few hours after her graduation ceremony, I asked my daughter to name the worst class she had taken \u2014 and the best. She easily remembered the worst one, but then, with equal facility, named four courses \u2014 psychopharmacology, psychopathology, population health, and the history of architecture in the U.S. \u2014 she said were outstanding ones. She enthusiastically described each of them, including the professors who taught them. It was exhilarating to see a young person, and my daughter no less, so excited about learning and scholarship.My son had a similar experience at UC Irvine, where he majored indata science, and then, partially as a result of the pandemic, stayed for an extra year to get his master\u2019sdegree in statistics.\u00a0He now has a job at Google. Both of them say they got a high-quality education on their campuses. This was achieved despite the huge increases in enrollment in recent decades.Read the full article inEdSource.CategoriesAcademicsHighlightStatisticsRelated PostsView ICS Project Expo-nential GrowthNewsICS Project Expo-nential GrowthJune 27, 2024View Pride Month 2024: Supporting LGBTQ+ in TechNewsPride Month 2024: Supporting LGBTQ+ in TechJune 25, 2024View Best Master\u2019s in Data Science for 2024 (Fortune)HighlightBest Master\u2019s in Data Science for 2024 (Fortune)June 25, 2024View A Generation of AI Guinea Pigs (The Atlantic)HighlightA Generation of AI Guinea Pigs (The Atlantic)June 25, 2024View Students \u201cUp their Game\u201d for 2024 Beall Butterworth CompetitionNewsStudents \u201cUp their Game\u201d for 2024 Beall Butterworth CompetitionJune 18, 2024View Tracing the Network Traffic Fingerprinting Techniques of OpenVPN (Comms ACM)HighlightTracing the Network Traffic Fingerprinting Techniques of OpenVPN (Comms ACM)June 18, 20246210 Donald Bren HallIrvine, CA 92697-3425(949) 824-7427Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterFollow us on YouTubeAdd us on LinkedInFollow us on InstagramFooter NavigationDirectoryFaculty & Staff ResourcesFaculty & Staff PositionsEmergency PreparednessAccessibilityPrivacy PolicyUCI HomeUCI DirectoryCampus Maps\u00a9 2024 All Rights Reserved.
