Now, more than a decade later, the Informatics capstone course is offered three times a year, and ICS has added undergraduate capstone courses for its computer science and data science majors. It also offers capstone courses through its Master of Human-Computer Interaction and Design (MHCID), Master of Computer Science (MCS) and Master of Software Engineering (MSWE) professional programs. Even with the global pandemic moving people out of classrooms and offices and into online spaces this past year, more than 130 ICS capstone projects were successfully completed.Tremendous Growth\u201cWe\u2019re growing in leaps and bounds,\u201d says Informatics ProfessorHadar Ziv, who led that first capstone course so many years ago. This growth was on full display at the ICS Spring 2021 Capstone & Student Design Showcase, where nine of the 12 projects presented were a mere sampling of the more than 60 projects completed for the undergraduate informatics, computer science, and data science capstone programs this year. You can view many of thestudent capstone videosonline.\u201cIt was hard to select projects [for the showcase] because they all were very competitive,\u201d says ProfessorSergio Gago-Masague, who led the new computer science capstone and its 16 projects after a successfulpilot versionlast year. Thecoursehas already grown from 50 to 70 students, and Gago-Masague plans to scale it up again next year.The capstone required for thedata science major\u2014 the first such undergraduate degree program offered in the UC system \u2014 resulted in 14 projects created by 42 students this year. The course is co-taught by two faculty members each year, one from the Computer Science Department and one from the Statistics Department. \u201cThe balanced and rigorous curriculum of the data science major allows students to take on a wide range of ambitious capstone projects, ranging from predicting medical treatment effects using electronic health records to using time series techniques to forecast product demand,\u201d stresses Statistics ProfessorVladimir Minin, who directed the data science program the last three years. Starting July 1, 2021, Statistics ProfessorMine Dogucuwill take the helm of the program.The other three projects presented at the Capstone & Student Design Showcase were award-winning designs from theButterworth Design Competition, a software development competition open to ICS students. The top prize \u2014 and $10,000 \u2014 was awarded to theGrasshopper Fund, a startup marketplace and funding platform.ICS has also witnessed growth at the graduate level, with the MCS Spring 2021 Capstone Showcase featuring 18 different projects, one of which,Armory, took third place in the Butterworth Design Competition. MCS students working on the Armory interactive platform, which lets developers experiment with various cybersecurity threats so they can proactively write secure code, were awarded $3,500.This year, another seven projects were completed for the MHCID program, and a joint MCS and MSWEWinter Showcasein December presented 46 projects \u2014 ten of which were created by the inaugural MSWE cohort of 34 students.Quantity and QualityThe growing number of projects isn\u2019t the only impressive element of the ICS capstone program. \u201cThe quality of the projects is also increasing,\u201d saysJason King, associate director of corporate relations in ICS. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more success stories on both the student and sponsor side as we refine the capstone process and devote more time up front to setting up the projects.\u201d This benefits the students, faculty and corporate sponsors. \u201cWe\u2019re not just doing projects to do projects,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re ensuring students gain the hands-on experience and soft skills needed for future success.\u201dZiv agrees. \u201cA couple of my teams were not only the best in their class, but among the best I\u2019ve taught in 12 years or so,\u201d he said, referring to theAdventure Biofeedback project, where students created a game environment to make speech therapy for kids fun, and theDreams for Schools project, where students helped a nonprofit STEM education program scale up its operations.The game environment for the Adventure Biofeedback project.In developing the speech therapy application, computer software engineering major Eduardo Magdaleno said it was an opportunity for him to apply \u201call of my culminated skills that I learned during my four years at UCI.\u201d He was able to practice Agile development, project management, HCI and more while working closely with the stakeholders. \u201cI did demos and user testing and learned that talking and eliciting the right questions was very important so our application could be built with the users in mind.\u201d Informatics majorStella Adriana, who helped design an Instructor Assignment Sorter forDreams for Schools, similarly talked during the showcase about how the project helped her learn how to effectively communicate with developers.Google software engineerTim Laubach, one of more than 120 participants at the online Capstone & Student Design Showcase, stressed the importance of the students learning this lesson. \u201cThe most beautiful design in the world \u2014 if it can\u2019t be implemented \u2014 doesn\u2019t help the user.\u201dGaining this practical, hands-one experience is what the capstone courses are all about. \u201cThere are things we just can\u2019t teach in a traditional classroom \u2014 the capstone course gives students a leg up as they transition out of their undergraduate degree and into their careers,\u201d says Informatics LecturerMatthew Bietz, who taught one of the capstone courses this year.Even those who already have a background in industry have a lot to gain from the capstone experience. \u201cWorking on this project has expanded my knowledge of agile development and working on a team, which will be significant in my career progression,\u201d says MCS studentUddeshya Kumar, who worked on an Artistic Photos application to help people create art from photos. \u201cThis project gave me the opportunity to learn new technologies that align with my professional goals and will prove to be crucial in the near future.\u201dA presentation of the Artistic Photos application.The project sponsors are yet another beneficiary of the capstone courses. \u201cProject sponsors tell me again and again how happy they are to have worked with the students,\u201d says Bietz. \u201cSome sponsors come from nonprofits [and] just this quarter, our students built apps to help victims of trafficking, to support parents of children with developmental disabilities, and to help cancer patients better understand their treatment using 3D visualization, to name just a few,\u201d he says. \u201cSome sponsors join us from startups or larger tech companies, and in addition to creating marketable products, working with the students is a way to identify individuals they want to recruit.\u201d This form of networking is invaluable to students and sponsors alike. \u201cFor all of the skill-building and new knowledge the students get,\u201d says Bietz, \u201cthe real impacts of the capstone program lie in building relationships, careers and passions.\u201dIf you are a company
