The Shenzhen, China teen went abroad her junior and senior year and landed in Orange County. And when her high school offered a joint summer program that brought her to UCI to explore campus and meet new students, she fell in love with the campus and its inclusive culture.\u201cThe welcoming and inclusive environment and the beautiful central park of UCI left me with an unforgettable impression,\u201d she says. She applied and was accepted to UCI as a freshman majoring in quantitative economics where she\u2019s been pursuing her passion for understanding data in a digitally driven world.\u201cThe explosion of data in our digital world opens up more positions for analytics and data scientists,\u201d she says. \u201cI chose quantitative economics because I love how this major combines the knowledge of economics and statistics to ensure both domain knowledge and analytical skills.\u201dShe soon picked up a double major in data science so she could develop a strong foundation in coding which has helped her greatly in processing large amounts of data. She also learned that visiting professors during office hours would help ease her shyness so that she\u2019d feel more comfortable expressing opinions and asking questions in class.\u201cMy professors have all been very friendly and they encourage students to express opinions. By taking various courses at UCI, I also got to build my leadership skills by collaborating with different students in group projects,\u201d she says.She gained solid research experience alongside professors Harding and Rahmani which helped her develop her own economics honors research project on student and parents\u2019 willingness to pay for higher education. And, following commencement next week, she\u2019ll be going on to Harvard for her master\u2019s degree in data science.\u201cI\u2019m so grateful my mother encouraged me to study abroad to meet different people and learn new cultures,\u201d Hu says. \u201cEven though I became more independent and mature as I studied alone abroad, her support along the way always motivated me to study and work hard while being open-minded.\u201dWith her last year at UCI spent online due to COVID, Hu counts her time in-person on campus among her best Anteater experiences. However, as she gets ready to move to Cambridge, Hu is already looking forward to coming back to UCI in the future to see how much the campus changes.\u201cOur campus is still refreshing \u2013 even when it was online. I look forward to the future when I come back to visit and get the opportunity to enter our newly constructed buildings and revisit the redesigned landscapes at our central park.\u201dArticle originally published atUCI School of Social Sciences.\u00ab Teach Access Recognizes Mine Dogucu as Curriculum Development AwardeeCapstone Program Showcases Growing Talent of ICS Students \u00bbQuick Links:News ArchiveUpcoming SeminarsSeminar Series ArchiveContact the Department\u00a9 2024 UC RegentsFeedbackPrivacy Policy"}
