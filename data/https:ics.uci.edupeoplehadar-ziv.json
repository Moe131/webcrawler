Here, at least half the faculty are experts in anthropology, psychology and all kinds of disciplines.\u201d The benefits, he says, are undeniable: \u201cThis is a place where, as a student and as a faculty member, you are absolutely enriched every day.\u201dTraining that Makes a DifferenceZiv finds enrichment \u2013 and reward \u2013 in teaching a variety of challenging courses, including undergraduate capstone project courses that empower students to tackle real-world design challenges. Building campus connections with corporations and community organizations, the courses give students hands-on experience developing mobile apps and other software that have a critical impact on audiences across Orange County and beyond. \u201cSuch a direct connection to industry is a beautiful thing,\u201d he says. \u201cVery often, students\u2019 apps get deployed through the Google or Apple app stores or are put to actual use in the organizations that sponsor the projects, giving the students an incredible advantage going out into the job market.\u201dA Place to Call HomePrior to his tenure as an informatics researcher and lecturer, Ziv obtained his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science at UC Irvine. His dissertation on the uncertainty principle in software engineering influenced the formative years of SCRUM and Agile methods and was later dubbed \u201cZiv\u2019s Law.\u201d What he found when he arrived at UC Irvine 30 years ago was a learning environment and community he is still proud to call home: \u201cI have been here for three decades,\u201d he reflects, \u201cand I am just as excited walking onto campus now as I have ever been.\u201d Also, through the project courses, Ziv says he \u201cengages with the \u2018real world\u2019 daily, serving as a proud ambassador of UCI.\u201dEducationPh.D., Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, 1997M.S., Information and Computer Science, University of California, Irvine, 1990B.S., Computer Science, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Israel, 1983Research AreasView Security, Privacy and CryptographySecurity, Privacy and CryptographyOur research spans a broad range of timely and important topics in security, privacy and \u2026View Software Engineering and SystemsSoftware Engineering and SystemsDeveloping new software technology and solutions that advance the information revolution...View CS EducationCS EducationDeveloping learning and teaching tools for information and computer sciences.Recent NewsView ICS Project Expo-nential GrowthNewsICS Project Expo-nential GrowthJune 27, 2024View UCI ANTrepreneur Center Announces Collaboration with the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer SciencesHighlightUCI ANTrepreneur Center Announces Collaboration with the Donald Bren School of Information & Computer SciencesDecember 13, 2023View A Productive Partnership: Entrepreneur Craig Caryl and the ICS Capstone ProgramInformaticsA Productive Partnership: Entrepreneur Craig Caryl and the ICS Capstone ProgramAugust 17, 2023View Conference Experience Confirms Competitive Edge of ICS Capstone ProgramComputer ScienceConference Experience Confirms Competitive Edge of ICS Capstone ProgramJuly 25, 2022View MSWE Capstone Project Modernizes Database for Elder Abuse Forensic CenterComputer ScienceMSWE Capstone Project Modernizes Database for Elder Abuse Forensic CenterDecember 21, 2021View CHOC Provider Connection: \u201cCHOC to launch pilot study on speech therapy app that UCI students helped develop\u201dComputer ScienceCHOC Provider Connection: \u201cCHOC to launch pilot study on speech therapy app that UCI students helped develop\u201dAugust 10, 2021View Informatics Capstone Team Develops \u2018Amplify,\u2019 Connects Kids With Speech Language ServicesInformaticsInformatics Capstone Team Develops \u2018Amplify,\u2019 Connects Kids With Speech Language ServicesAugust 9, 2021View Capstone Program Showcases Growing Talent of ICS StudentsInformaticsCapstone Program Showcases Growing Talent of ICS StudentsJune 22, 2021See all news6210 Donald Bren HallIrvine, CA 92697-3425(949) 824-7427Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterFollow us on YouTubeAdd us on LinkedInFollow us on InstagramFooter NavigationDirectoryFaculty & Staff ResourcesFaculty & Staff PositionsEmergency PreparednessAccessibilityPrivacy PolicyUCI HomeUCI DirectoryCampus Maps\u00a9 2024 All Rights Reserved.
