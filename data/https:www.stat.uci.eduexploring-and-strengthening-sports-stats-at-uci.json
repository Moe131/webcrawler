Did you question how basketball teams were favored during this year\u2019s March Madness? Have you ever wondered if there\u2019s really a career path in sports related to UCI\u2019sdata sciencemajor? If so, thewebinar seriesbeing offered by theSport Statistics Group @UCIthrough the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) should be of interest to you. The next webinar, to be held on May 21, 2021, will featureBrendan Kent, a senior business data analyst at DraftKings and creator and host of theMeasurablespodcast.\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of interest around sports research right now,\u201d says Statistics ProfessorMichele Guindani, who is helping Ph.D. studentCorey Brett Katzlead the new group, along with Statistics ProfessorsHal SternandWeining Shen. \u201cSports excites many people, so we\u2019ve started hosting seminars to introduce students to the types of problems one might work on in sports stats.\u201dProviding a Behind-the-Scenes Look at Sports StatsIn the February webinar, \u201cPresenting Sports Research to an Average Sports Fan,\u201d ESPN Senior Sports Analytics SpecialistPaul Sabintalked about the work that goes into providing the game predictions shared by ESPN newscasters and appearing on the channel\u2019s news ticker.The Sport Statistics Group\u2019s February webinar featured ESPN Senior Sports Analytics Specialist Paul Sabin.In particular, he recounted his first few months at ESPN, when he was tasked with improving the college basketball power index (BPI) leading into the 2016 NCAA Basketball Tournament. Using a Bayesian model with coefficients such as \u201chome team\u201d or \u201caway team\u201d and \u201cdistance traveled,\u201d he did a posterior predictive distribution, which ESPN started using for its on-air predictions. After the \u201cfinal four\u201d games for the men\u2019s tournament, the model Sabin developed gave Villanova a 50.1% chance to win the championship over North Carolina.\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that 50.1 and 49.9 are essentially the same thing, statistically they\u2019ve very similar,\u201d explained Sabin. Regardless, the prediction running along the bottom of the ESPN channel had Villanova, with its 50.1%, favored to win.\u201cWhen you work in sports, you start having these rooting interests that have nothing to do with anything rational,\u201d admitted Sabin, who had no ties to either school and didn\u2019t really care who won. Yet based on his model, ESPN had predicted a Villanova win, so he suddenly became very invested in that outcome. \u201cI have never been more nervous than I was at this moment.\u201d He replayed the moment he was referring to during the webinar, transporting viewers to the final seconds of the 2016 championship, just as North Carolina tied the game.\u201cWell, my model was very close, 50% and the game is tied with five seconds left,\u201d he recalled thinking at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s what the highest probability was \u2014 this outcome \u2014 but I also wanted people to not lose trust in me.\u201dVillanova then won the game with a buzzer-beater basket. \u201cThe game had an incredible finish,\u201d said Sabin, and the ESPN prediction had been correct. (There\u2019s more to the story, including a statistical twist and lessons learned, so if you\u2019re affiliated with UCI, be sure to watch therecordingwith your UCnet ID.)During the webinar, Sabin also talked about how \u201cit was sports that really generated my love of statistics in the first place,\u201d and he explained how using sports analogies helped him make sense of difficult concepts in college. When he couldn\u2019t grasp the idea ofn-dimensional space, he thought of it in terms of having five different variables and trying to predict the outcome of a game. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to understand concepts if applied to a passion like sports,\u201d he said, which he views as opportunity for introducing new students to statistics. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that using sports can help increase diversity in STEM education.\u201dGuindani similarly views sports as a potential recruitment tool. \u201cIt\u2019s an area that provides opportunities for getting students excited about statistics.\u201dLeveraging Sports Webinars for RecruitmentSabin\u2019s talk was one of a series of webinars offered by the Sport Statistics Group. Recordings of the other webinars are available online with your UCnet ID:\u201cCareer Paths in Statistics,\u201d withLuke Bornn, co-founder and chief scientist of Zelus Analytics (recording);\u201cData and Statistics in Baseball: What it\u2019s Like to Work in a Baseball Analytics Department,\u201d withKevin Ferrisof the Boston Red Sox andRichard Andersonof the Cincinnati Reds (recording); and\u201cWatching Sports Through the Eyes of a Statistician,\u201d withHal Sternof the Department of Statistics (recording).As noted earlier, the next webinar will featureBrendan Kentof DraftKings and creator theMeasurableseducational sports analytics and sports tech podcast. While a UCnet ID is required to view recordings of previous events, the live webinars are open to anyone \u2014 from high school students exploring potential majors and career options to professional sports analysts or even international statisticians. Visit theEventspage for log-in information.However, the long-term goal of these webinars is to help recruit a dedicated group of UCI students interested in working on a variety of projects related to sports stats. The hope is that students, after watching a webinar, will get involved with the Sport Statistics @UCI group. \u201cAny UCI students can join the group \u2014 all ICS students are welcome, as well as students who might be majoring in a different field, e.g. economics or psychology,\u201d says Guindani. \u201cIt would be awesome to put together a group that could eventually collaborate with UCI\u2019s athletics department or other local sports teams.\u201dAnyone interested in learning more about joining or collaborating with the group can visit theSport Statistics Group @UCIwebpage or emailsportstatisticsUCI@gmail.com.\u2014Shani Murray\u00ab UCI News: \u201cHal S.
