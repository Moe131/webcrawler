The GRFP has a history of selecting recipients who go on to achieve high levels of success, and the promising work of these ICS recipients shows great potential in positively impacting society.Elizabeth Ankrah, a second-year Ph.D. student in theDepartment of Informaticsand a member of the Social & Technological Action Research (STAR) group, is addressing health inequities faced by those living with chronic illness. \u201cTo have my work recognized by the NSF is a great honor,\u201d she says, adding that \u201ccommunity, commitment and consistency are the three pillars\u201d supporting her life and work. \u201cBeing a Ghanaian-American, I was taught to always consider the impact of my work on the family and community, and along the way this transitioned into a passion for conducting research that reduces health inequalities.\u201d She is currently working with patients in the childhood cancersurvivor clinicat Children\u2019s Hospital of Orange County. \u201cMy goal is to understand the social and informational needs and challenges of now-adolescent and young adult survivors of childhood cancer and their caregivers,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m interested in understanding people\u2019s care journeys [and] how we can translate that into their care trajectories [and] organize and create programs and technologies for their care based on their lifestyle.\u201dAdam Birnbaum is a second-year master\u2019s student in theDepartment of Statisticswho will start on his Ph.D. in the fall. He is focusing his research on developing flexible methods for modeling spatiotemporal data that make fewer assumptions but are still easy to use by practitioners. \u201cThis could, for example, be used to improve our understanding of health disparities among groups of people depending on where they live or work,\u201d he explains. \u201cWith more and more data being gathered and more and more decisions driven by those data, I\u2019m excited to help improve our ability to understand the world through statistical methods.\u201d He was also greatly honored to receive the fellowship. \u201cTo me, it really signifies the quality of education and mentorship I\u2019ve received in the Department of Statistics here at UCI.\u201dEmani Dotch, who will start graduate school in the Department of Informatics this fall, is researching human-computer interaction and accessibility with an emphasis on design technologies for children with autism spectrum disorder. \u201cTo receive this fellowship is a huge honor,\u201d she says. \u201cIt will provide additional help with my graduate school expenses [so] this is such a huge blessing.\u201d Her plan is to stay in academia. \u201cMy future goal is to go into academia as a professor and start a nonprofit organization and camp for children with autism and other developmental disorders, empowering and encouraging neurodiversity in the STEM fields.\u201d\u2014Shani Murray\u00ab Amstat News: \u201cCelebrating Women in Statistics 2021\u201d (Annie Qu mentioned)UCI News: \u201cHal S.
