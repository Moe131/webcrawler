To help meet this demand, the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) is currently accepting applications for the new Master of Data Science (MDS) program it is launching in the fall of 2021. Anyone interested in joining the inaugural cohort of this 15-month professional graduate program canapply online. The early application deadline is December 15th, 2020. After that, applications will be accepted on a rolling basis until April 15th, 2021.\u201cWe see lots of demand coming from individuals who were trained in computer science, for example, without rigorous statistical training,\u201d saysDaniel Gillen, chair of the Department of Statistics. \u201cWe also see demand coming from individuals who were trained in mathematical sciences and statistics but don\u2019t have the computing background,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd then there are a lot of individuals coming from other disciplines as well\u2026 from business analytics backgrounds [and] from political and social science backgrounds.\u201dSo whether you\u2019re in the tech industry, at a financial institution, in a domain such as education or healthcare, or a recent graduate looking for more training, this program is designed to advance your data science skills. While there are minimumcourse requirements, the goal is to fill certain gaps in training while providing practical, hands-on experience.\u201cWhat makes this program unique is that it is going to be taught and delivered by world-renowned experts in the foundations of data science, meaning both statistics and computing,\u201d says Gillen. The courses will cover applied probability and mathematical statistics, statistical modeling and computing, machine learning, data management and visualization, and artificial intelligence. More importantly, they will be evenly split between faculty from the Department of Statistics and the Department of Computer Science, both of which are housed in the School of ICS.\u201cIndustry is learning very quickly that a lot of people can scrape and analyze data, but to do something truly meaningful with data \u2014 to make decisions [that will] drive the industry forward \u2014 you really have to have a basic foundational understanding of the methods you\u2019re using,\u201d says Gillen. \u201cThat is what drives the philosophy of this degree.\u201dThe program spans five quarters, with the first three quarters comprising coursework in both statistics and computer science. The summer quarter is available for internships or additional courses. To accommodate working professionals, all courses will be offered in the late afternoon or evening, and for those in need of financial assistance,scholarships and financial aidare available.The final quarter is the capstone course, where students will work on industry-derived projects, gaining real-world, hands-on experience. \u201cWe plan to partner with businesses to help generate not only contacts for students but also interesting capstone projects.\u201d(If your business is interested in sponsoring a capstone project, please contact Bryan Munoz atmds@ics.uci.edu.)Furthermore, because this program adds to the list of successfulprofessional programsalready offered through the School of ICS, students will have access to dedicated career counselors and will participate in showcase events. So while the goal is to keep the initial MDS cohort relatively small, students will be able to leverage resources and events available through the established graduate programs. \u201cIt will be fairly selective, so we\u2019re aiming at 50 students for the first cohort,\u201d says Gillen, though that might grow in future years. This select group of students will gain experience in using relevant data-related software and technologies so they can thrive as data scientists, whether their goal is to work in the tech industry or government or anywhere in between. \u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on taking what is learned about the foundations of these disciplines,\u201d stresses Gillen, \u201cand applying them to real-world data.\u201d\u2014Shani Murray\u00ab A Campus Gem: UCI\u2019s Statistical Consulting ServicesA Look at Health and Technology Trends for 2021 and Beyond \u00bbQuick Links:News ArchiveUpcoming SeminarsSeminar Series ArchiveContact the Department\u00a9 2024 UC RegentsFeedbackPrivacy Policy"}
